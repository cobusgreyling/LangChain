Cogman wrote two pages\\' worth of text detailing the lineage of four noble houses. The text concerning house Umber was shown in episode four, and the Baratheon text appears in episode six. Cogman also wrote text for the houses of Targaryen and Royce, but the corresponding scenes were removed from the final script for \"Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things\" but the Targaryen page was shown in \"A Golden Crown\".

Rather than divide the text in half chronologically, Martin opted to instead split the material by character and location, resulting in \"two novels taking place simultaneously\" with different casts of characters. \\'\\'A Feast for  Crows\\'\\' was published months later, and the concurrent novel \\'\\'A Dance with Dragons\\'\\' was released on July 12, 2011.

By the mid-1990s, he had won three Hugo Awards, two Nebula Awards, and other awards for his short fiction. Although his early books were well-received within the fantasy fiction community, his readership remained relatively small and Martin took on jobs as a writer in Hollywood in the mid-1980s. He worked principally on the revival of ''The Twilight Zone'' throughout 1986 and on ''Beauty and the Beast'' until 1990, but he also developed his own TV pilots and wrote feature film scripts. He grew frustrated that his pilots and screenplays were not getting made and that TV-related production limitations like budgets and episode lengths were forcing him to cut characters and trim battle scenes. This pushed Martin back towards writing books, where he did not have to worry about compromising the size of his imagination. Admiring the works of J. R. R. Tolkien in his childhood, he wanted to write an epic fantasy, though he did not have any specific ideas.\\n\\nWhen Martin was between Hollywood projects in the summer of 1991, he started writing a new science fiction novel called ''Avalon''. \", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'_split_id': 7, '_split_overlap': [{'doc_id': '82c1368aa5fcae44b5cbda7d85f4197f', 'range': (0, 186)}, {'doc_id': '2ab1c9e627da8454e883ec988891dc22', 'range': (1042, 1173)}]}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': '943c2b8dde89495b4524b5d7735e965'}>,\n",

Putting ''Avalon'' aside, Martin finished this chapter in a few days and grew certain that it was part of a longer story.

Daenerys questions Tyrion's ability to serve as her Hand after so many mistakes in judgment, but after talking to Jorah privately, she acknowledges that Tyrion is useful to her, and orders him down in the crypts during the battle against the dead for his own safety, to his chagrin. During the battle, the Night King reanimates the Starks buried in the crypts; Tyrion and Sansa hide together, prepared to face the horde, but soon the Night King is killed and the Army of the Dead destroyed.\\n\\nWhile preparing to travel south to besiege King's Landing, Tyrion learns from Sansa of Jon's heritage as a trueborn Targaryen. He tells Varys, who considers whether Jon is a better option to rule Westeros than Daenerys. Tyrion recommits to Daenerys and reveals Varys' treachery, and Daenerys executes Varys. Tyrion convinces Daenerys to halt the destruction of King's Landing if the people surrender, signalled by the ringing of the city's bells. \", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'_split_id': 36, '_split_overlap': [{'doc_id': 'b9dcf85d996c25f0446ea72696975765', 'range': (0, 224)}, {'doc_id': '86a047374c920fc5fbf1425652ed48ce', 'range': (1025, 1163)}]}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': '29e3fe4799bd6561f6cb999040fb8c2e'}>,\n",

George R.R. Martin set out to make the story feel more like historical fiction than contemporary fantasy, with less emphasis on magic and sorcery and more on battles, political intrigue, and the characters, believing that magic should be used moderately in the epic fantasy genre. Martin has stated that \"the true horrors of human history derive not from orcs and Dark Lords, but from ourselves.\"A common theme in the fantasy genre is the battle between good and evil, which Martin says does not mirror the real world. Just like people\\'s capacity for good and for evil in real life, Martin explores the questions of redemption and character change. The series allows the audience to view different characters from their perspective, unlike in many other fantasies, and thus the supposed villains can provide their side of the story.
